  <h1>Classes</h1>
  <p>We provide dance classes almost every day of the week and offer classes that will help you master nearly every
    facet of dancing salsa. If you wanted to spin until the floor started to smoke, let the music speak through you or
    just wanted to have fun, we have a class that is right for you.</p>

  <p>We currently offer classes in two locations. Both locations provide a progressive class structure that teaches the
    core of the dance in a highly technical fashion. These classes focus on giving you a way to understand the dance,
    deconstruct it and make it your own, not just give you some random moves a random teacher showed you. Technique and
    timing are the underpinning of the classes taught at the Body Balance location.</p>
